        <h2>The Discovery: A Subtle Header Swap</h2>
        <p>During a recent penetration testing assessment, I uncovered a rate-limit bypass vulnerability that felt familiar but with a unique twist. The target API, like many others, had a rate-limiting mechanism to prevent abuse. However, after hitting the rate limit, I found that replacing the <strong>Authorization Bearer token</strong> with a <strong>Cookie header</strong> allowed me to bypass the limit. Interestingly, the cookie didn’t need to correspond to a valid session or user state—it only needed to be syntactically valid.</p>
        
        <h3>The Discovery: A Subtle Header Swap</h3>
        <p>The rate limit was triggered once the system encountered a specified request threshold. After reaching that threshold, requests were typically blocked with standard error messages like `302`, `400`, and `429`. However, once I added the Cookie header, additional requests were allowed without hitting any barriers, regardless of the previously applied rate limits.</p>

        <h3>Digging Into the Technical Details</h3>
        <p>While I couldn’t confirm the root cause without backend access, I made some educated guesses about why this worked:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Session Context Overrides:</strong> Rate limits are often tied to a user's session. Replacing the Bearer token with a Cookie header might make the request appear as if it’s from a new session, resetting the rate-limit counter.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Authentication Mechanism Fallbacks:</strong> If the system supports both token-based and cookie-based authentication, it’s possible that the presence of a cookie might override the Bearer token, bypassing rate limits applied to token-based requests.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Rate-Limit Key Confusion:</strong> The system likely uses a unique key to track rate limits. Replacing the token with a cookie could modify this key, causing the system to treat the requests as coming from a new entity.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Response Code Patterns:</strong> The varying response codes (`302`, `400`, `429`) could indicate different handling of requests based on the headers. This might point to inconsistent session management or rate-limiting logic.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Why This Is Significant</h3>
        <p>This discovery highlights how small details, like swapping authentication methods, can introduce vulnerabilities. While the bypass itself might not sound catastrophic, it opens up avenues for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>API Overuse:</strong> Attackers could potentially make unlimited requests, scraping data or performing other malicious activities.</li>
            <li><strong>Credential Stuffing:</strong> Insufficient rate-limiting could allow brute-force attacks on authentication endpoints.</li>
            <li><strong>Operational Impact:</strong> Unchecked traffic could degrade API performance or cause outages.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Harvesting:</strong> Attackers could collect sensitive user information for malicious use, such as identity theft or fraud.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Déjà Vu: A Familiar Theme</h3>
        <p>This wasn’t my first time discovering a rate-limit bypass using cookies. In a previous assessment (detailed <a href="#">here</a>), I found that combining a session cookie with an OAuth token allowed bypassing rate limits. This time, it was simpler: just a straightforward token-to-cookie swap. It shows how often such vulnerabilities arise when multiple authentication mechanisms are used together, often due to a lack of alignment between them.</p>

        <h3>A Thoughtful Takeaway</h3>
        <p>This discovery isn’t a critique of the development team—it’s a reminder of how easily systems can behave unexpectedly when different authentication mechanisms are combined. Such findings serve as a learning opportunity for developers to refine their systems and create stronger, more resilient protections.</p>
